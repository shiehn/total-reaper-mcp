## Usage

To use the complete API:

1. Use the new complete implementation files:
   - `server/app_complete.py` - Full Python MCP server
   - `lua/mcp_bridge_complete.lua` - Full Lua bridge

2. Start REAPER and load the complete Lua bridge

3. Run the complete server:
   ```bash
   python server/app_complete.py
   ```

## Available Methods

The complete list of 94+ methods is available via the MCP protocol. To see all available methods, connect an MCP client and call `list_tools()`.

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
pytest tests/test_full_api.py -v
```

## Notes

- This implementation provides access to the majority of ReaScript's functionality
- Some complex functions may require additional implementation for full compatibility
- The generic Lua handler can call most ReaScript functions dynamically
