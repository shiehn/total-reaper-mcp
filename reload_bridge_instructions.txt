To reload the Lua bridge in REAPER with the new handlers:

1. In REAPER, open the Actions List (Actions > Actions List)
2. Run the action "Script: reload_bridge_in_reaper.lua"
   OR
3. Manually run the script at:
   /Users/stevehiehn/total-reaper-mcp/scripts/reload_bridge_in_reaper.lua

The bridge will be reloaded with the following new handlers:
- CreateTrackSend (already working)
- SetTrackSendUIVol
- SetTrackSendUIPan  
- SetTrackSendInfo_Value

This will fix the routing send test failures.
